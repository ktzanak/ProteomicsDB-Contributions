# ProteomicsDB-Contributions

### www.proteomicsdb.org

This repository contains all my contributions to the ProteomicsDB project hosted on GitLab.

1. The contributions were exported as a JSON file using the GitLab API endpoint https://gitlab.lrz.de/api/v4/users/{USER_ID}/events
2. The JSON file was parsed and converted to a plain .txt file included in this repository.
3. A GitLab-style contribution heatmap was generated from the .txt file using a Python script.
