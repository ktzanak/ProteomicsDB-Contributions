# ProteomicsDB-Contributions

### www.proteomicsdb.org

This repository contains all my contributions to the ProteomicsDB project in GitLab.

1. The contributions were exported to a json file using the GitLab API "https://gitlab.lrz.de/api/v4/users/{USER_ID}/events"
2. The json file was parsed and converted to the txt file included in this repo.
3. The txt file was visualized in a GitLab-style heatmap using a python script.
